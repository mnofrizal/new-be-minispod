### Phase 4.5: Pod Name Synchronization & Metrics Enhancement (Previously Completed - August 26, 2025)

#### Pod Name Synchronization Critical Fix

- **Problem**: When subscription upgrades triggered Kubernetes rolling updates, new pods got different names but database stored old pod names
- **Root Cause**: Pod selection logic filtered for "Running" pods only, missing newly created pods in "Creating" or "Pending" state
- **Location**: [`src/services/k8s/provisioning.service.js:439-450`](src/services/k8s/provisioning.service.js:439) - Enhanced updateServiceInstance method
- **Solution Applied**:
  1. **Status-Agnostic Selection**: Removed filtering for "Running" pods only
  2. **Timestamp-Based Selection**: Always selects newest pod by creation timestamp regardless of status
  3. **Smart Timing**: Added 3-second delay after deployment ready to allow new pod creation
  4. **Database Sync**: Automatically updates pod name in database after subscription upgrades
- **Maintenance Function**: [`src/services/k8s/provisioning.service.js:738-748`](src/services/k8s/provisioning.service.js:738) - refreshInstancePodName for manual synchronization
- **Result**: Database pod names now always reflect current Kubernetes pod names after rolling updates

#### Subscription Metrics Endpoint Implementation

- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/subscriptions/:subscriptionId/metrics` - Real-time metrics for frontend polling
- **Controller**: [`src/controllers/subscription.controller.js:316-420`](src/controllers/subscription.controller.js:316) - Complete metrics endpoint with simplified response
- **Route**: [`src/routes/subscription.routes.js:47-51`](src/routes/subscription.routes.js:47) - JWT-authenticated metrics route
- **Features**:
  - **Pre-calculated Percentages**: CPU and memory usage as percentages (usage/limit \* 100)
  - **Simple Units**: CPU in millicores, memory in MB
  - **Clean Structure**: Only essential data for dashboard display
  - **Real-time Ready**: Perfect for 5-10 second polling intervals
  - **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing instances or K8s unavailability
- **Response Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "instanceId": "cmeslquw90007vv4azb9pes44",
    "status": "RUNNING",
    "cpu": { "used": 7, "limit": 500, "percentage": 1 },
    "memory": { "used": 225.93, "limit": 1024, "percentage": 22 },
    "urls": { "public": "https://...", "admin": "https://..." },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26T14:13:37Z"
  }
  ```
- **Testing**: [`rest/subscription.rest:363-445`](rest/subscription.rest:363) - Comprehensive test suite with polling simulation

- **Database Migration**: [`prisma/migrations/20250825031600_custom_transaction_id`](prisma/migrations/20250825031600_custom_transaction_id/migration.sql:1)
- **PostgreSQL Sequence**: Created `transaction_id_seq` starting from 101 for reliable auto-increment
- **Utility Service**: [`src/utils/transactionId.js`](src/utils/transactionId.js:1) with generation, validation, and extraction functions
- **Schema Update**: Added `customId String @unique` field to Transaction model
- **Service Integration**: Updated all transaction creation across credit, payment, and admin services
- **Testing**: Verified sequential increment and format validation (TXMP-105, TXMP-106, etc.)
