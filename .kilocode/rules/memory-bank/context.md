# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

The backend API has **completed Phase 1: Database & Core Models** and is ready for Phase 2: Public Catalog API implementation. The project now has a complete service catalog foundation with credit-based billing system.

## Recent Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

**Foundation Layer (Previously Completed):**

- **User Authentication System**: Complete JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
- **User Management**: Registration, login, profile management with role-based access
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Comprehensive monitoring of pods, deployments, nodes, namespaces, ingresses, and services
- **Admin APIs**: Complete administrative endpoints for K8s resource management
- **Metrics Collection**: CPU and memory usage monitoring for pods with unified container data structure
- **Network Monitoring**: Ingress and Service monitoring with detailed network configuration data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging system

**Phase 1: Database & Core Models (Just Completed):**

- **Complete Database Schema**: All service catalog models implemented (ServiceCategory, Service, ServicePlan, Subscription, Transaction, ServiceInstance)
- **User Model Enhancement**: Added credit fields (creditBalance, totalTopUp, totalSpent)
- **Database Migration**: Successfully applied with comprehensive seed data
- **Core Service Layer**: 6 comprehensive business logic services implemented
- **Midtrans Integration**: Complete payment gateway integration ready
- **Simplified Quota System**: Real-time quota management with database transactions
- **Credit-Based Billing**: Complete credit management system
- **Subscription Management**: Full subscription lifecycle management
- **Transaction System**: Comprehensive transaction handling and reporting

### ðŸ”„ Current State

- **Environment**: Development setup with local PostgreSQL database
- **Database**: Complete service catalog schema with sample data (3 categories, 3 services, 7 plans)
- **Core Services**: All 6 services tested and working properly
- **Payment Integration**: Midtrans configuration validated and ready
- **Progress**: 55% complete (increased from 25%)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 2: Public Catalog API)

1. **Public Catalog Endpoints**: Create REST API controllers and routes for service browsing
2. **Wallet Management API**: Create user wallet management endpoints with Midtrans integration
3. **Webhook Controllers**: Implement Midtrans webhook handling
4. **API Validation**: Add Joi validation schemas for new endpoints

### Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

- **Subscription APIs**: User subscription management endpoints
- **Kubernetes Provisioning**: Automated service deployment to K8s cluster
- **Instance Management**: Service instance lifecycle management
- **Auto-renewal System**: Automated billing and subscription renewal
- **Admin Dashboard**: Management interfaces and analytics

## Key Decisions Made

- **Database**: PostgreSQL chosen for reliability and ACID compliance
- **ORM**: Prisma selected for type safety and developer experience
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens for security and scalability
- **K8s Client**: Official Kubernetes JavaScript client for cluster integration
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of controllers, services, and utilities

## Recent Implementation History

### Pod Service Response Structure (Fixed)

- **Issue**: Pod API was returning duplicate container information
- **Location**: [`src/services/k8s/pod.service.js`](src/services/k8s/pod.service.js:91-130)
- **Solution**: Merged container spec info with metrics into unified structure
- **Result**: Single `containers[]` array with name, image, ready status, and usage metrics
- **Improvement**: Added `metricsTimestamp` and `metricsWindow` at pod level for better data context

### Kubernetes Network Monitoring (Implemented)

#### Ingress Endpoint Implementation

- **Location**: [`src/services/k8s/ingress.service.js`](src/services/k8s/ingress.service.js:1), [`src/controllers/k8s/ingress.controller.js`](src/controllers/k8s/ingress.controller.js:1)
- **Features**: Complete ingress monitoring with rules, hosts, TLS configuration, and backend services
- **API**: `GET /api/admin/k8s/ingresses` - Admin-only endpoint for ingress resource monitoring
- **Testing**: [`rest/admin/k8s-ingresses.rest`](rest/admin/k8s-ingresses.rest:1) - REST client for endpoint testing

#### Service (Network) Endpoint Implementation

- **Location**: [`src/services/k8s/service.service.js`](src/services/k8s/service.service.js:1), [`src/controllers/k8s/service.controller.js`](src/controllers/k8s/service.controller.js:1)
- **Features**: Comprehensive service monitoring with ports, IPs, endpoints, and service types
- **API**: `GET /api/admin/k8s/services` - Admin-only endpoint for Kubernetes Services monitoring
- **Testing**: [`rest/admin/k8s-services.rest`](rest/admin/k8s-services.rest:1) - REST client for endpoint testing

#### Infrastructure Enhancements

- **Kubernetes Config**: Enhanced [`src/config/kubernetes.js`](src/config/kubernetes.js:1) with NetworkingV1Api client
- **Route Integration**: Updated [`src/routes/index.routes.js`](src/routes/index.routes.js:1) with new network endpoints
- **Consistent Architecture**: All new endpoints follow established controller-service-route patterns
