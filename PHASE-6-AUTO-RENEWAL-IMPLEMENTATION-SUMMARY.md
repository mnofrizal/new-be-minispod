## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Auto-Renewal Processing Logic

```javascript
// Daily renewal processing workflow:
1. Find subscriptions due for renewal (nextBilling <= now)
2. Validate credit balance and quota availability
3. Process credit deduction with transaction recording
4. Update subscription dates (endDate, nextBilling, lastBilled)
5. Handle failures with grace period assignment
6. Send notifications (success/failure/admin summary)
```

### Grace Period Management

```javascript
// Grace period workflow:
1. Set 7-day grace period on renewal failure
2. Daily reminders during grace period
3. Retry renewal if credit becomes available
4. Suspend subscription if grace period expires
5. Terminate associated service instances
```

### Notification System

#### Notification Types:

- **LOW_CREDIT_WARNING**: 3 days before renewal
- **RENEWAL_SUCCESS**: After successful renewal
- **RENEWAL_FAILURE**: When renewal fails (with grace period info)
- **GRACE_PERIOD_REMINDER**: Daily during grace period
- **SUBSCRIPTION_SUSPENDED**: When subscription is suspended
- **ADMIN_BILLING_SUMMARY**: Daily admin reports

### Enhanced Upgrade System

#### Rollback Capabilities:

- **Quota Rollback**: Automatic quota reallocation on failure
- **Credit Rollback**: Reversal transactions for failed upgrades
- **Subscription Rollback**: Database state restoration
- **Instance Rollback**: Kubernetes resource state preservation
